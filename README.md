Peer-reviewed data-cleaning

This repository contains a script (run_Analysis.R) and associated codebook (CodeBook.Rmd, CodeBook.pdf) to download and extract the freely available datasets "Smartphone-Based Recognition of Human Activities and Postural Transitions Data Set" from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Smartphone-Based+Recognition+of+Human+Activities+and+Postural+Transitions. The script then filters and manipultes the data to produce a single tidy dataset that retains only the mean values of selected feature variables across both subject identity ("id") and the target label ("activity").
